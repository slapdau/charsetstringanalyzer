This file provides configuration for the Charset based string searcher.

The file lists character sets that a user may select as byte encodings
used when searching a program for strings. The user may select any number
of encodings. During a string analysis, the program will be selected
for all strings in any of the encodings.

A copy of this file may be located as data/SearchableCharsets.xml in
any module. All copies found will be combined into an overall configuration.

If a character set is listed in any file at least once, it is available for
selection as a search character set. If a character set is marked as
enabledByDefault in any file at least once, it is selected as a search
character set by default. Only character sets that are not marked as
enabledByDefault in any file will not be selected by default.

Only character sets known to ghidra.program.model.data.CharsetInfo can
be enabled. The set of known character sets can be extended by creating
a new subclass of java.nio.charset.Charset (with matching
java.nio.charset.spi.CharsetProvider), and/or adding to charset_info.xml.

Since adding a new character set to Ghidra will require packaging it in a
module, the module may containg its own copy of data/SearchableCharsets.xml
to make the new character set searchable.

Unknown character set declarations will be discarded.

Since character sets that have byte order markers, such as UTF-16 and
UTF-32, do not behave well with this analyser, they are also discarded.
However associated character sets that have a defined byte ordering and
do not require a leading byte order marker are permitted. For example,
UTF-16BE and UTF-32LE are permissible.
